# Puzzles
Collection of puzzling problems around math, computer science, probability and whatever enjoyable

Each folder will contain a puzzle with my personal solution(s). I'll try to add the reference to the source of the puzzle when I found it, and I'll try to classify them with an incremental number and a general tag for understanding if it is Math, Science, Programming related. This Readme will contain also the full list of these puzzles with their title (the one I created)
